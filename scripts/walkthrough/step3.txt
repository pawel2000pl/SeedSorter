Step 3

  In the file "~/.seedsorter/GpioConfig.ini" in section "[Configuration]" set "DelayTime" 
  to your own time which will be the best for the machine (it depends on the decline and seed).

  Type:
  'sudo systemctl enable seedsorter' to enable the service forever [recomended]
  'sudo systemctl disable seedsorter' to disable the service forever
  'sudo systemctl start seedsorter' to start the service once
  'sudo systemctl stop seedsorter' to stop the service once
  
  After typing recommended command you can type 'sudo reboot' to reboot the computer.
  And then you can use buttons:
    * push green (for about 1s): start analyser
    * push red (for about 2s): stop analyser
    * push red (for about 10s) till status diode will blink: shutdown the computer (required before switching power off)
